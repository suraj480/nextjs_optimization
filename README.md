## Lazy Loading in Next.js

Lazy loading is a technique where **components**, **images**, or **modules** are loaded *only when needed*—usually when they enter the viewport or are triggered via user interaction (e.g., a button click).

### 🚀 Benefits of Lazy Loading

- ⚡ **Reduced initial page load time**
- 📈 **Improved overall performance**
- 😀 **Enhanced user experience**, especially on slower networks

### ✅ Next.js Supports Lazy Loading For:

- 🖼️ **Images**
- 🧩 **Components**
