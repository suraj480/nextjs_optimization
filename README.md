## Lazy Loading in Next.js

Lazy loading is a technique where **components**, **images**, or **modules** are loaded *only when needed*—usually when they enter the viewport or are triggered via user interaction (e.g., a button click).

### 🚀 Benefits of Lazy Loading

- ⚡ **Reduced initial page load time**
- 📈 **Improved overall performance**
- 😀 **Enhanced user experience**, especially on slower networks

### ✅ Next.js Supports Lazy Loading For:

- 🖼️ **Images**
- 🧩 **Components**
- 📦 **Sections**

## Eager Loading

Eager loading refers to **preloading or pre-importing components or assets** so they are available immediately, instead of waiting for a user action or viewport trigger.

### 📌 Common Eager Loading Use Case

- 📦 ** 1.Static import of components** (i.e., not using `dynamic()`)
2.Images
3.Fonts -Use next/font with eager configuration
4.Scripts
5.Routes use Router.prefetch()
```
